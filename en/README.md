## Preparation before the fight

### Quadcopter ground control station preparation

A good point for a **quadcopter ground control station** is the roof of a high-rise building.

- [ ] Connect power from **Battery** to **Control Unit** and to **Quadcopter Remote Control**.
- [ ] Connect power from **Solar Panel** to **Battery**.
- [ ] Connect **Cable** from **Control Unit** to **Quadcopter Remote Control**
- [ ] Position the **Solar Panel** so that it receives light for most of the day - on a hill, away from objects from which a shadow can fall on it
- [ ] Position the **Quadcopter control panel** so that its antennas are perpendicular to the signal reception plane from the potential location of the quadcopter in combat. For a good signal, the section between the antenna and the quadcopter should not be blocked by the walls of houses in flight
- [ ] Position **Quadcopter** in ready-to-fly state at the starting point of the flight
- [ ] Deploy Arrows **Quadcopter**
- [ ] Make it as horizontal as possible
- [ ] Ensure that there is no debris around 0.3 meters from the **Quadcopter**
